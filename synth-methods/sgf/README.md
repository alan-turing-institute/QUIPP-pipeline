# SGF

[SGF](https://vbinds.ch/node/69) is a synthetic generation tool that provides
a privacy guarantee based on plausible deniability.

See also [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07975).

## Additional synthesis parameters

These directly correspond to configuration options passed to the sgf tools.
More detail about these inputs can be found in the SGF documentation.

- `gamma` (_number_): Must be > 1.0.  Privacy parameter which controls how the
  *plausible seeds* for a record are determined.
- `omega` (_integer_): The number of resampled attributes is N - omega
- `ncomp` (_string_): Composition strategy. Options are Sequential
  composition ("seq") or Advanced composition ("adv")
- `ndist` (_string_): The noise distribution in the generative model: "none", 
  "lap" (Laplacian) or "geom" (Geometric).
- `k` (_integer_): Minimum number of plausible seeds that a synthetic data point needs to have to be released.
- `epsilon0` (_number_): Differential privacy parameter
- `tinc` (_integer_):  Steps size to create for trade-off curve (between 1 and k - 1).

For more detail in the parameters please refer to the README.pdf file found in the SGF package.
