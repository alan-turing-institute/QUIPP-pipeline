# SimpleWorld dataset

This dataset was used for several examples in [Spatial Microsimulation with R](https://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/), by Robin Lovelace and Morgane Dumont. While small, it is nevertheless useful for testing out new techniques.

The source files can be found on the book's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/spatial-microsim-book/tree/master/data/SimpleWorld), and were released under an MIT License.
