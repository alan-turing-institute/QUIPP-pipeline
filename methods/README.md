- synthpop (multiple imputations library in R)
- GAN (4 versions: vanilla GAN, CGAN, WGAN and WCGAN), currently only on `Credit Card Fraud Detection` dataset.
- CTGAN (Conditional GAN for Tabular data)
- simPop (micro-simulation using IPF, Simulated Annealing and model-based synthesis, designed for datasets with household structure). Currently only on embedded Austrian census data set)
- SDV (Synthetic Data Vault, parametric model synthesis library in Python, using the multivariate version of the Gaussian Copula)
