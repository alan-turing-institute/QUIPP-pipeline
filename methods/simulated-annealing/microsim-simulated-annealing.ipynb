    "We apply the simulated annealing algorithm to a **microsimulation** task in this short example. Microsimulation can be used to combine individual-level and aggregate datasets that are available at different spatial resolutions in order to produce a synthetic population where every individual within has a detailed set of characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may occur in a scenario where individual-level data is available over a large area (e.g. samples from the census), but the data is needed on a smaller spatial scale. If the numbers of people with certain properties are known at a finer spatial resolution from another data source, it is possible to generate a synthetic population at a smaller spatial scale where the properties of the people within are consistent with the second data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "The synthetic population generated by microsimulation techniques can be used in further simulations, such as agent-based models, where the characteristics of each simulated individual in the population must be known."
