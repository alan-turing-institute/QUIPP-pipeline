# Computational environment setup for QUIPP-pipeline

To provide a consistent computational environment for this project, we use the `repo2docker` tool to construct a Docker image that contains the programming languages and libraries specified by the configuration files in this folder.

[repo2docker](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the tool that is used under-the-hood by [BinderHub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to create Docker images of a repository that a user wishes to launch on a [Binder service](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) such as [`mybinder.org`](https://mybinder.org/).
We use the same tool here to produce a Docker image that is easily compatible with BinderHub.

The resulting Docker images are available from Docker Hub: [`turinginst/quipp-env`](https://hub.docker.com/r/turinginst/quipp-env).

## Running the QUIPP pipeline using a container

**TODO**: *Similar to Running the pipeline header on main README*

## Configuration files

There are four configuration files present in this directory.
Together, they contain the information needed for repo2docker to create a Docker image that contains all the dependencies specified in the files.

`runtime.txt`
This file contains details of the environment that we want to set up.
The file contains the line `r-2020-03-01` to indicate that we would like the R language to be installed, and that packages should be downloaded from the snapshot of [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) that was collected by [MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/timemachine) on 1st March 2020.
This means that we should obtain consistent versions of the R packages across new builds of the Docker image.

`install.R`
This file lists the various R packages required by the methods used in the QUIPP-pipeline repository.

`requirements.txt`
Python dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
Python itself will be automatically installed once repo2docker detects the presence of this file.

`postBuild`
This script contains commands that are run after the repository has been built.
We use `postBuild` to remove the files that are copied into the image, to yield a "blank slate" to which code can be added later.

See [#22](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/QUIPP-pipeline/issues/22) for a more detailed discussion of why this particular set of configuration files was used.


## Updating the Docker image

The Docker image will be updated periodically as we use additional or newer versions of libraries in the QUIPP-pipeline project.
For now, this will be done manually; see #?? for notes on the move to continuous integration.

To add new R or Python libraries, the name of the library should be added to the `install.R` or `requirements.txt` file as appropriate.

For other languages, see the [guides](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/languages.html) in the BinderHub documentation (generally, this will involve using `postBuild`).

To create the Docker image, we must first set up repo2docker.
Here, we'll install repo2docker into a Python virtual environment.
```
cd <path to QUIPP-pipeline>
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

With that set up, it's time to create the Docker image.
We call repo2docker with the following arguments, detailed below:
```
$ jupyter-repo2docker --subdir env-configuration --image-name quipp-env-0.0.1 --user-name jovyan --user-id 1000 --env SGFROOT=/home/jovyan/sgf/bin .
```
`--subdir` We build the image based on the contents of this directory.

`--image-name` The name of the Docker image generated by repo2docker.

`--user-name` The user name of the primary user of the image. We follow BinderHub and use the name "jovyan".

`--user-id` We also follow BinderHub for the user ID of 1000.

Running this command will also launch a Jupyter server, to which you can connect via the URL given in the terminal output.
This is a good time to check that everything has been configured correctly, but if you would rather not start the server, use the flag `--no-run`.

Once the build has completed, we can get its ID from the output of the following command...
```
$ docker image ls
```
...and can then push the image to Docker Hub using the following:
```
$ docker login docker.io
$ docker tag 341baa92e34a turinginst/quipp-env:0.0.1
$ docker push turinginst/quipp-env:0.0.1
```
